# Protein Prediction

The goal was to predict the class of ~380 observations (proteins) in the test file. The data were messy, and had missing values. It was also not obvious how to include information from the additional file Protein_interactions.csv, into the training data.

## Data Preprocessing

We found incomplete records for training and testing data.

**Training data -> 5.21%**
**Testing data -> 19.37%**

Incomplete variables were also present.

- Chromosome
- Essential
